                    <p> My journey with Habitat for Humanity started about 20 years ago and I’ve learned so much from these unique experiences — from working alongside volunteers to turning over homes for families, and eventually seeing their lives transform.</p>
                    <p>I admire the people’s dedication and sacrifices they have made in this organization. They remind us that there is always another day — there is always hope that things will get better.</p>
                    <p>Our work will not stop until everyone has a decent home to go to everyday, and I hope that our mission to assist our fellow Filipinos will transcend generations. Together we can make a difference!

                    <p>Your donation will support families in their desire to own dream homes and provide a sustainable livelihood for families in Habitat communities.</p>

                    <p>Resilience comes from the relationships you form with other people. You build trust, respect, and genuine care for each other.</p>
